What is GoLang?
****************

Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by
Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in
2009 as an open-source programming language. Go is a statically typed,
compiled programming language. Go is syntactically similar to C, but
with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style
concurrency. Go is an open source programming language that makes it
easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
