The Python-Telegram documentation is a great place to learn and understand the basics!!

## Steps to set up the bot ##

Use the token generated by telegram and replace it bot.py

In order to host it on heroku, one can follow these simple steps:

1.Create an account on Heroku

2.Hosting on Heroku requires 2 files in addition to the executable file, a Procfile and a requirements file.I have included both of them in the repository

3.pip freeze --local > requirements.txt can be used to generate the requirements

4.Here since, I am running a python script, I have used python3 in the Procfile

5.heroku login, executed from the CLI

6.git init , to initialize a git repository of all the contents

7.heroku create to create allocate an instance of a remote server

8.Use the URL generated and replace it in the bot.py file

9.git add . , to add all the contents

10.git commit 

12.heroku git:remote -a name of the application generated

11.git push heroku master, to push all the contents
