## About MWOC

Mexili's Winter of Code is a month long Open Source program hosted by Mexili. The main aim of this program is to get students started with opensource and help them to develop skills needed for real-world software development.

It also aims to increase participation for a bigger open source program, which is Google Summer of Code, by preparing students from different universities and colleges through this program.

Students are paired with mentors who mentor and provide correct exposure to the students. Above all, we hope you get encouraged into the world of open source and develop more code for the benefit of all.
