* JavaScript (abbreviated as JS),is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.

* JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

* JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. 

* Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.
