# Convert Frames to Video

This python script will convert all the frames from a folder into a video. This is accomplished using OpenCV, a highly optimized library for computer vision applications. Specifically, we use the VideoWriter function to combine images(in a particular fps) and obtain a video.

## Setting up:

- Create a virtual environment and activate it

- Install the requirements
``` sh
  $ pip install opencv-python
```

## Running the script:
``` sh
  $ python frames_to_vid.py [image_folder_path]  #without the brackets  
```
The script will ask you for the needed 'fps' and a video name.
## Note:

The images in the folder should be numbered in the order in which they appear in the video.

After running the script, the video will be created in the directory where the script is running.
