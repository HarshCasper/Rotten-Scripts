# PathFinding
This project finds the shortest path between the starting and ending points in a grid.

See the project at : [PathFinding](https://akshit2511.github.io/PathFinding/)

### Meet the Algorithms
This application supports the following algorithms:

```
* Breadth First Search
* Dijkstra
* A*
```
> Please note A* algorithm uses *Manhattan Heuristic* by default.

### Features
* This application makes use of the algorithms mentioned above and tries to find the shortest path.

* The user can allow the diagonal moves also, by clicking *'Allow Diagonal Moves'*.

* The user has the liberty to choose the starting and endpoints according to his will. Also, there is an option to set obstacles in the path.

*  The grid can be resized under *'Grid Size'* option. 

* On clicking *'Find Path'* , the path is displayed in the grid. An alert box is displayed if the finder was unable to find the path.
