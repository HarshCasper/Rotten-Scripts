# Troubleshoot

Hello fellow contributors and Open-Source enthusiasts. Welcome to **Rotten-Scripts** :octocat:

This Styling & Troubleshooting guide wil help you to get rid of errors and warnings that might have popped up during the
mandatory **GitHub Checks**.

A list of currently working GitHub Checks can be found [here](../workflows).

In terms of style checking we have these actions -

1. md_lint
2. md_spell
3. md_link
4. py_lint
5. Deepsource

We also have our own separate [STYLING GUIDELINES](../../README.md) as well, you are kindly requested to go through
that file in order to solve all the CODE related errors.

Please be advised that we may even reject a Working Pull Request, if it fails the minimum
`Programming Styles and Standarads`.

In this Troubleshoot guide, we will help you to sort out all the errors related to.

- **Lint Code Base** i.e. [md_lint](../workflows/md_lint.yml)
- **Check Spellings** i.e. [md_spell](../workflows/md_spell.yml)
- **Check Markdown** links i.e. [md_link](../workflows/md_link.yml)

## Lint Code Base

## Check Spellings

This action lists out all the possible spelling mistakes in your `README.md` file.
It is strongly suggested that you spellcheck all your files before uploading anything to maintain the aesthetics
of the Repo. If there are spelling mistakes in your file, the action will fail,
you can check the incorrect spelling as well.

It is strongly advised to correct those spellings or the PR might be outright rejected.
For more help Read our [STYLING GUIDELINES](../../README.md).

If you believe that some words are wrongly pointed out and/or you want your name to be ignored by the Action.

It is recommended that you add the word to the [wordlist](.wordlist.txt).

Kindly note that any wrong edit can cause breaking changes.

Steps to Consider:

- Use `git checkout` to navigate to the branch in your remote which was used to open the PR.
- Add the required words in [wordlist](.wordlist.txt) **in your branch**.
- Remember to add every word in a new line.
- Run the following command

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added Words in Wordlist"
git push -u origin <branch>`
```

## Check Markdown links

This action checks for dead links/broken links.

Kindly ensure that all the links are working before you finalize your Pull Request. A list of possible status code,
and the workaround can be found below.

- 200: Active code - Your link is working properly :grinning:
- 206: Partial success - Only a part of request is being successful, None the less, link is active :grinning:
- 400: Bad Request - A client side error, is there any typographical mistake, Recheck your README, try visiting the
site from your browser too! :thinking:
- 404: Not Found - The website is not responding, is it dead, recheck your README asap, correct the link or add an
alternative. :raised_eyebrow:
- 429: Too many requests - Overwhelming! Just surpassed the rate limit of the website, it's fine, the site is up and
running. :dizzy_face:
- 999: Blocked by agent - Everything is working fine, some agent like LinkedIN and Spotify block multiple request
from their side. It is recommended that you mention this in your PR, so that maintainers can affectively deal
with the error. :roll_eyes:

Don't worry maintainers are trying their best to keep the repository fully automated with minimal errors,
in case you find something you are more than welcome to mention it in your
[Pull Request](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts/pulls), open an
[Issue](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts/issues), or start a
[Discussion](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts/discussions).
