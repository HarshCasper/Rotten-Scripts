## What is GoLang?

Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language. Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
