==================================

Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

Step 0 : Find an issue
----------------------

- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

Step 1 : Fork the Project
-------------------------

-  Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in ``upstream`` remote.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   $ cd <repo-name>
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>

-  If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git remote update
   $ git checkout <branch-name>
   $ git rebase upstream/<branch-name>

Step 2 : Branch
---------------

Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.

.. code-block:: bash

   # It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
   $ git checkout -b branch_name  

Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned
-----------------------------------

-  Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
-  Add all the files/folders needed.
-  After you‚Äôve made changes or made your contribution to the project
   add changes to the branch you‚Äôve just created by:

.. code-block:: bash

   # To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
   $ git add .
   # To add only a few files to Branch_Name
   $ git add <some files>

Step 4 : Commit
---------------

-  To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:

.. code-block:: bash

   # This message get associated with all files you have changed  
   $ git commit -m "message"  

-  **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should
   be squashed.

Step 5 : Work Remotely
----------------------

-  Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.
-  When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

.. code-block:: bash

   # To push your work to your remote repository  
   $ git push -u origin Branch_Name  

-  Here is how your branch will look.
