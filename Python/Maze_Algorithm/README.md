# Maze-Algorithm
The breadth first search algorithm is a very famous algorithm that is used to traverse a tree or graph data structure. It is guaranteed to find the shortest path from a start node to an end node if such path exists. This algorithm can be used for a variety of different tasks but for this example we will use it to solve a maze.

## How it works
In short the breadth first search algorithm creates a set of all possible routes and attempts each one until it finds the end node. It is a queue based algorithm. It is extremely inefficient and is not ideal for large data structures. Once the algorithm finds a path that reaches the end node it is guaranteed that this is the shortest possible path. This is because of the queue structure that the algorithm uses.

## To run the code

(Preferable IDE - Jupyter Notebook)
- Clone the folder- Maze_Algorithm
- You must have python ,opencv and numpy installed
- In cmd do:
  - `pip install numpy`
  - `pip install opencv-python`
  - Also check for any package that's need to be installed, on cmd
  - then run the script in jupyter lab/notebook!
