Its rows and columns are numbered from       $$$1$$$ to $$$R$$$ and $$$1$$$ to $$$C$$$, respectively.  The inhabitants of Chess Land are usually mentioned as pieces in everyday       language, and there are $$$5$$$ specific types of them roaming the       land: pawns, rooks, bishops, queens and kings. Contrary to popular       belief, chivalry is long dead in Chess Land, so there are no       knights to be found. Each piece is unique in the way it moves around from square to       square: in one step,    a pawn can move one row forward (i.e. from row $$$r$$$ to         $$$r+1$$$), without changing columns;   a rook can move any number of columns left/right without         changing rows OR move any number of rows forward/backward         without changing columns;   a bishop can move to any square of the two diagonals         intersecting at its currently occupied square;   a queen can move to any square where a rook or a bishop could         move to from her position;   and a king can move to any of the $$$8$$$ adjacent squares.      In the following figure, we marked by X the squares each     piece can move to in a single step (here, the rows are numbered from     bottom to top, and the columns from left to right).             Recently, Chess Land has become a dangerous place: pieces that       are passing through the land can get captured unexpectedly by       unknown forces and simply disappear. As a consequence, they would       like to reach their destinations as fast (i.e. in as few moves) as       possible, and they are also interested in the number of different       ways it is possible for them to reach it, using the minimal number       of steps – because more paths being available could mean lower       chances of getting captured. Two paths are considered different if       they differ in at least one visited square. For this problem, let us assume that pieces are entering Chess       Land in a given column of row $$$1$$$, and exit the land in a       given column of row $$$R$$$. Your task is to answer $$$Q$$$       questions: given the type of a piece, the column it enters row       $$$1$$$ and the column it must reach in row $$$R$$$ in order to       exit, compute the minimal number of moves it has to make in Chess       Land, and the number of different ways it is able to do so.  Input The first line contains three space-separated integers $$$R$$$,       $$$C$$$, and $$$Q$$$ $$$(1 \leq Q \leq 1000$$$, $$$2 \leq C \leq       1000$$$ and $$$C \leq R \leq 10^9)$$$ – the number of rows and       columns of Chess Land, and the number of questions, respectively.       Then $$$Q$$$ lines follow. Each line consists of    a character $$$T$$$, corresponding to the type of the         piece in question ('P' for pawn, 'R' for rook, 'B' for bishop,         'Q' for queen and 'K' for king);   two integers $$$c_1$$$ and $$$c_R$$$, $$$1\leq c_1,c_R\leq         C$$$, denoting that the piece starts from the $$$c_1$$$-th         column of row $$$1$$$, and has to reach the $$$c_R$$$-th column         of row $$$R$$$.   Output You have to print $$$Q$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th one containing       two space separated integers, the answer to the $$$i$$$-th       question: the first one is the minimal number of steps needed, the       second is the number of different paths available using this       number of steps. Since the answer can be quite large, you have to       compute it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. If it is impossible to reach the target square, output the line       "0 0".
