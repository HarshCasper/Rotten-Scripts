# WhatsApp COVID-19 Bot

A COVID-19 Bot build using `Twilio API`, that tracks the Number of Infected persons, Recovered Persons and Number of
Total deaths along with the day-to-day increase in the statistics. The information is then updated via WhatsApp.

## Note

The script requires personal info, like `API-Token`, `API-ID`, and `PHONE-NUMBER`
for that reason, a [`.env`](.env.example) file has been used, for more info, see usage.

## Usage

- Setup a Virtual Environment.
- Download dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Set up an account at [`Twilio`](https://www.twilio.com/). It's Free.
- Follow 
  [this guide](https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-to-send-whatsapp-message-using-python-and-twilio-api-fc63f62154ca)
  for Setting up WhatsApp API.  
- Make a `.env` file similar to `.env.example` file.
- Paste the required information:

    ```text
    SID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" <ACCOUNT SID goes here>
    TOKEN="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" <AUTH TOKEN>
    NUM="+91XXXXXXXXXX" <TARGET PHONE NUMBER GOES HERE>
    ```

- The bot script is now ready.
- For scheduling, [`apscheduler`](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  has been used for cron-style scheduling.
- The script is coded to run the bot once every day.  
- For making your own cron schedule, use this [website](https://crontab.guru/).
- After setting up the Cron Job, run the scheduler script using `python3 schedule.py`.
