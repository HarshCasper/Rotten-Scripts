# Track Data Usage

Now, the world is all about internet, and the data! We have now apps for tracking the usage of data but they consume a lot of space in our smart phone, so how can we tackle that? Well, there is one way, using Python. Yes, we can use Python to automate this stuff to track our data usage.

## Prerequisites

1. vnstat
2. Python3
3. Linux OS
4. WiFi connection to your system.

## Understanding the Code

Firstly, you have to use a Linux system for this program, because the `vnstat` is available on Linux system only. I have used RHEL7 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux).

1. To install `vnstat`, visit [here](https://www.tecmint.com/install-vnstat-and-vnstati-to-monitor-linux-network-traffic/#:~:text=To%20install%20vnStat%20in%20RHEL,source%20tarball%20as%20shown%20below.)

2. Now, let's understand the code.

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

import os
import sys
import time
import threading
import subprocess as sp
```

The `os` module in python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS, comes under Python's standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

`sys` â€” System-specific parameters and functions. This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

The Python `time` module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings.

`threading` module constructs higher-level threading interfaces on top of the lower level \_thread module. To know more, visit [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html).

The `subprocess` module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.

Now, I have implemented a class `network`, so that we can access this program from anywhere, in which there are two functions i.e. `main` and `monitor`.
