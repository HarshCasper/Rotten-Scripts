Tags Scraper is working set of Python scripts which crawls over the URLs
of Google Searches and gives out the result of most frequently used
words by webpages of the search result. Having idea regarding the most
used keywords can help in optimising

Description
-----------

This project is modularized in 4 Modules

-  **URL_generator** : It’s an independent module which generates Google
   accepted URL with all the valid parameters. It can be extended
   further by adding support for other Search engines as well.

-  **SearchResults** : SearchResults module takes the search query as
   input and returns the list of links of ``<div>`` tag, which are
   searched result’s pages link.

-  **Fetch_Tags** : Fetch_Tags module takes in the list of URLs
   generated by SearchResults , visits each URL, scrapes data of Title
   tag, H2 and H3 tag and alt tag and count for how many times each word
   has been used in different webpages.

-  **Main** : Main module is what we need to interact with. It combines
   the functionality of other three modules into 1 whole. The data
   generated is Stored in Keywords Data.txt file.

Working
-------

-  After installing all the required libraries, run the main.py script.
   ``main.py`` is the driver module. Run in in the CLI or in IDE.

-  When you’ll run the main module, it will ask for
   ``Enter Search Query``, and you need to enter the query for which you
   want top keywords just like you search in google search bar , it will
   start fetching results .

-  It will try to fetch 100 results but can be less due to inaccessible
   pages and broken links
