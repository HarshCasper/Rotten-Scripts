Oh
You know what? Heres the deal
Well
Yeah. Alright
Can we not?
Still want that.
Cuginos pizza.
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain
What did I do to deserve this?
No.
Oh
Hi
Im going to take a trip. Im going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Can I go?
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where Im going yet. Its kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
What is that?
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But
When did you go there?
Really for like how long?
Where do I want to go?
No. Were not.
Which means absolutely nothing.
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that youve got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today
Youve got to wave your arms and youve got to pound your fists. Many times. Its supposed to emphasize your point.
Ok
Ok
Maybe. Thanks.
Yeah. Im definitely going.
Im going. Im a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But
I dont know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
Im... leaving on June 8th.
Yeah. And Im really sorry about that
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Alright.
Bribery. Nice.
The ocean.

No
Hey. ...Oh

So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&Ms
Which we realize sounds crass
...What?
Yeah
...Okay.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
Just... quit stalling.
Such a dork.
How old are you?
Well thats an invasion of privacy
You... owe me.

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

...Its something to think about.
You look cute today
So
I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.

Oh
Oh
Oh...
Cmon!
presses drink button
Hi.
How much time do you have left on your break?
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just dont get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
Yeah
Dwight tried to kiss me.
And I didnt tell anyone because Im not really sure how I feel about it.
Well
Well
Well
You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Yeah...
Hey... you know what
Well
This came out really well.   There you go.
Oh.
What did I write?
Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
That actually took a while. I had to put
Just a simple macro. You know
Yeah
Maybe Stanford would be cool.
Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
Sure you do
No
Pam
Im the one who complained about you.
I... I didnt know that Toby was gonna write it down.   I was just venting.
You know
And I took it right back. It was like...
Hey
Oh
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
I can always kind of win at roulette.
Yeah.
Mind control.
Ever since I was a little kid
It was just little thing
Okay

I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Guys
What are you doing?
Till Death Do Us Rock.
Oh.
Wait

No Im not drunk. Are you drunk?
Are you really gonna marry him?   ...Ok.

The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
And even though... I came back
Pam.   Sorry.   Um
All right. Then... its a date.
Really
How much did you pay for it?
You paid for it?
I broke up with Karen after the job interview
Oh that sounds fun. Im mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
Yeah.
What?
Who was driving?
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
Oh good
I can also take 3 people.
I think shes awake.
I wouldnt... I wouldnt worry about it. Dont touch it.
I will do some research.
Six of one
So whats your strategy for this race?
Mm-hmm.

Wait. What?   You knew? And you didnt say anything?
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.

Or a gong.
Really? Power gel?
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
What?
Yeah
Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Sure well go.
Oh Im sorry. What?
Nope.
Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.
Hows it going?
Yeah?
You look a little worried.
Okay. Um

Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work
And thats when I knew. You?
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Wow

Does the Department of Health know about this?
Uh
That reminds me
Darn it!
No
Where are you going out tonight?
I wouldnt understand or a secret?
I cant believe this place is real. I mean
The Beets Motel? That is
How are you doing this?
Nice.
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.

Yeah
Just thought that I heard crying
Good night
You okay?
Are you a cocktail waitress?
No
Dwight

Yeah
Yeah
Ah

Okay.
Yep
Nobody tell him!

You know what?
Okay
Im just doing my job
Good! Fine! Ive got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee...
What? What?

Michael is on a mission to prove that hes creative. Which I think is odd
Well
Mmm... Id prefer to sit in back.
Nnnno. Uh
I have to. Pam
Well
Well
All right
Okay
You embarrassed me.
How much time do I have?
So
My friends basement. All right

I think thats the question that you had...
Wow.
All right.
What are you guys doing?
Oh yeah
Good eye - its an oval.   Youre measuring the table.
Do you?
Yup.
Now
We should probably get back.
I didnt have anything
Im sorry. She scares me.  walks away
Whats that?
I actually know a s*x model.
Yep. Yeah. Shes blind
Okay.
Yes.
Oh
Will do.   Ill stop calling.

Well
Lets be honest
Oh

Who else is he mean to?
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
Shes never worn these glasses before.
Well
A formal warning
And no one cared.
Productivity? My numbers are good.
If your client likes Italian food
Yeah
Hi.
He didnt mention me
Thanks
Ive always gotten along well with Toby. Uh
Scared me. Hows the party planning going?
So its going great
Hey.
Thats cool.
Sure!
Good one?   Thats a cool camera.
Okay
Do you honestly believe that?
Im gonna get a second opinion.
Okay
Is Ryan gonna fire me? I dont know. I know that Ive done everything I can
Hey
Why wouldnt you see him? You work for him.
Okay
smiles
Ah
No
Because most of the time
But what have you learned about her?
Nice.
Well
Ill just go later.
So you have the directions.
You have a toothbrush.
You have a cell phone charger.
Come on
What happened?
Call me when you get in.
Bye.
Why havent I proposed yet? Uh
I cant believe Im saying this
I dont really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant
All right
All right!
So what is going on
Uh-huh.
Thats not what that is.
I would like to lose 65 pounds.
Cryogenics. Beer me five.
All right
Nope
Maybe put up some shelves.
OK
No.
Hi.
Oh
Some girl came into Pams room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So Im in here waiting it out.
Well thats great.   Youre talking about your court ordered community service?
But he did
All right.
Nope.
Mmm.
How much weight have you lost
No
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually. But um
Fair question.
See
Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that Im convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I havent seen her in 10 days. Hows your summer?
So as it turns out
I know. I suck.
Dwight says Hi.
Now he is saying Hi louder.
Umm...
Hey
OK.
Im gonna write you up for not working.

Hey
Perfect.

I just... couldnt wait.
Pam
So?
Hey
Hey Dwight.
Whats up
Alright. Ill tell everybody here that you say hi.
Why
Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didnt tell them.
I just didnt
OK. You know what? Here we go.   Uh
Nope.
Thank you Angela.
Yes.
To get married.
Yep.
Nice.
Dwight
Jackpot.
starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns
Oh you had said that you dont do anything personal during work time so... Im just making sure.
Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds.
One second.
Hey
By any chance
Actually not. It was really so-so.
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff. You know
You know
Storys kinda bland. Its about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
He has not stopped working for a second. At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open
19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
So maybe youre not completely ethical after all.
Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now
Right
Oh. Right
OK...
Wait
OK.
No... way!
Ha ha. Thats hilarious?
Who
Uh...
OK
Jan enters the office
What do we have here?
Really...
Hey! You busy?
OK
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church
Oh. OK
Hey
Hey
You must be out or something.
Is it me
Hope you didnt have any major laundry issues.
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Yet here you are
Wish you were home. Uh
I miss you.
We were robbed last night.
So apparently Pam went out last night
Im on minute six of this message.

Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank.   Oh
Yeah
You wouldnt tell your mom?
Those reports affect our bonuses
Aww.

Nope.
You must be really proud.
Oh
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee thats in here and you could use   uh
How can you even be sure?
Make the face.   Yeah
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
It is... more of a spicy brown
How was your meeting with Michael?

Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Theres the charm.
That is me. Wish me luck.
Thanks.

Sure.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace
Why dont we head in your office to talk?
Michael
Michael
Really?
You will? Wanna do it right now?
I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.

So instead
No.
Hi David.
Wow
Thank you.
Ah

Yes.
Okay
Okay. Yesterday
I am.
Right.
Yes

Really? You just agreed to that?
walks in
Really? Hey
Stanley?
Okay
Michael
Thats not what I meant.
I disagree.
Great. Guys
That is not what I said

David
Nope
Alright
You dont have to lie.
Right.
Alright. Lets get started.
Do you mean
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
Its hard to tell so far.
Im sorry
You just came up with that.
Yeah. Okay
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
Pro-- no favoritism.
Ive been studying Michael for years
You know
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. Course I know that this might come off as biased
Im not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
Michael.
Look
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
But there is a reason why Im here!
No
I dont think youre good at making tough decisions!
At thinking out the options
But maybe Im here for a reason

Could I have everyones attention
Look
Ooh
Really what it is
Okay
Wow! Im just gonna rewind and back off a bit
Thank you

Michaels my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
Thank you.
Whats in here?
Ooh!
We would really appreciate it.
It is really special.
Well
Believe it or not

Good-bye.

They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
I absolutely dont understand

Dave.
Dave.
Yeah. Ive spoken to them on the phone.
Yes
No thanks.
Mmm-hmm.
...and paper.
Nope. No.
Hes trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
I outran it.
Ill just leave that suit in your office then.
Mmm... its like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Truthfully
Ok. Great meeting
I think you just gotta ride this one out
No
Maybe if you make fun of yourself itll all go away.
Really? Do it. I am a big

Oscar
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.

I didnt ask you.   Would you like to talk?
I shouldve grabbed you. Im sorry. Look
Hes alright.
Thanks Michael.
Oh man
Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. Ill talk to them.

Pams sales are fine actually.

Penny for your thoughts.

Shel Silverstein.
You set the bar so high.
Okay
Stop.
Hey.
Inappropriate.
All the time.
Yeah.
She wants it bad Michael.
I can.
And I dont support her choice to hit you.
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
I just need some time.
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.
Feel better?
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know
OK
OK
So lets just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you
And what if he comes at you with the other hand
Oh my God
You two are so evenly matched I dont know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
Are you serious?
Michael in his office playing music loudly
Listen
Thats it.
That rhymes
Alright
Sure Im a little nervous
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero
OK
Hey
I thought we agreed that we wouldnt do things like this.
Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
OK
OK
Alright guys
Oh
No
Or maybe hes just stuck in character.
Both. Theyre both worse.
Its going to be alright. Were a good company
Michael
Michael
Michael
Caleb!
Today of all days...
Ill take it.
Hey David.
Oh
Sure. Oh
OK.
See ya.
Nothing yet.
Well there is some bad news.   There has been another murder.
Conference room everyone.
No.
I think today was a good day to have two managers. Cause if youre a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent. Oh
Michael
Yeah
Five years ago
The next year he really stepped things up.
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I cant remember.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Mmm.
God bless you
Hey
But if the company doesnt go under then well finally have all our contacts in one program.
Could go either way.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
Ok.
Nah. Might as well do it now.
Hey
Ok. You shouldnt be telling me that stuff and also shouldnt be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
I care about them and Im just as much of a boss as Michael.   Whats so funny? Im a co-manager.
Well - who? How did you? Who
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?
Who here heard it from Ryan?
Yes.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?  Pam
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
To be honest
Oh
Well
Hey
Mmm-hmm.
Simple data entry
You know what?
I think I know the problem.
I think you seem distracted.
But
I am
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second.   Hey
Let me show you what I mean.   Your new office. How great is that
Right.
Youre a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once youre in there. Enjoy it.
Wait
Wow
Hmm

Well
Okay

Will everybody stop for a second
Dwight?
No
Look
Okay.

Thats what I want.
What would Bob do?
Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
Can I just talk to you for a second?
You cant yell out I need this
Yup.
Michael
Great!

And if you want Michael as Santa
No.
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.

There was one thing we were curious about
Oh

Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
No.
Oh
Anybody could have walked in.
Whoa
Ill take over. Um
Alright.
No.
I dont think so.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
Do you even know what that means?
Um...
This is way more than I make now.
I dont think Im gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say theyre not in it for the money? Well
Hey
Actually
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
Yeah!
Really.
No
Why would you do that?
Mm!
You gotta do something
What is that?
Oh. Im fine. Thank you
Why would I wanna do that?
For now
Yeah. Thank you.
Hey.

Well
For the record
Hey
Thats it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.

Alright.
Yep.
Hey
Yeah
Not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home

Alright. So why dont you just give me my share of the leads
Hey
Ahh
I dont think you understand -
This ones a map.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Oh my god
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies   - thats just unfair.
How about this one - When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face
I love you.
Michaels stupid scavenger hunt.
Lincoln.
It involves you too.
Phew! Cant wait for this day to be over.
Just all the - drama.
Between the - us and you guys. Its unnecessary

Shes wearing a onesie  holds out his cell phone
Didnt we kind of start it?
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable
I dont think we need opposed.
Ill text Pam. Shes really good at this stuff.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Alright. Then were back to cash. And I got to say
No
No
Yes! We do.   Eclairs.

I made a sale.

Wow.

Good one.
Absolutely
I gotta tell you
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight
I did not see this coming.
Okay.
Why?
Youve been gone for a long time.
Easy.
Oh
Would you like to be our fourth?
All right.
So what do you think?
About Julie?
Yeah.
So you like her?
So Pam was right?
About you two hitting it off.
Hey
You want to just make a run for it?
What is happening?
Michael
Wow. Maybe we should tell her that hes not normally like this.
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
It stopped.
All right.
See ya. Nice girl.
You all right?
Actually
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
Whats up?
Dwight
Oh
Sorry
I think you need to go a little easy. You cant just suspend someone form work.
And I got to take this bad attitude
Yeah
Buenos dias
All right
Yeah
Thats a good point.
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
I dont even know who you are anymore.
Oh
How are you?
All right.
So
Hold on one second.
What?
None of this is time sensitive.
No.
Well
Okay. Well
What?
What was that?
Pam
Hey
Uh
Yeah.
Whats that?
I dont... I dont think so.
What if shes just flirting with you to get a better price?
She does not like him.

Well
It is totally insane.
Nobodys for.
Okay.

But you didnt believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
Thats interesting. Wow
Oh
You know Michael
Michael
You should stop this
What?
Wait
Nice effort.
Thats... not okay.
Stanley
So were gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Exactly. It happened in Big.
Im really too tired to do this.
Then lets just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
We can order in from Hooters.
Billy Joel Rock Band.
Now youre just being hurtful.
Pam.
Yeah
Sorry about that.
Well
Excellent. Go for it.
Right? So
Now
Ah.
What about an energy drink or something?
Well
A place?
Okay.
So instead of working
Okay.
What was you? You were the leak?
Uh-huh.
Whyd you do that?
Yeah.
Okay
This is a very good idea. This is good. Lets get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
Guys
Really?
I mean
Hey
No... sport.
Hey
Wow
Thats right. The janitor said that. By the way
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldnt know for sure cause I dont have a trained ear. Thats why I have to use one of these.
Yep. Wait

What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building
Oh
Well
Oh
But youre comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
Yep. Thats exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like
You follow him on Twitter?
Pam?
I did not do this.
This is impressive.
Do they call you that?
Come on
Oh! Of course there is. Hey
Great.
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
Is there really?
Aaah!
Wait. Is this your place Dwight?

Wait a second. You know you cant buy that now
Thats it.
Stop
Did you just say you remember him?
What does that mean?
Lets just go.
There it is. Alright.
Thats pretty good.
Yes!
Its my own fault-
Really?
For a lot of reasons.
You should actually thank Erin

Youre an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
What do you mean?

Oooh! You cant handle the truth!
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Hey.
When you work hard
Yeah. I mean
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.

Psst. You think this things gonna go much longer?
Ohh! Good-bye.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies

No. We took a walk.
Threat Level : Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.

cracking up at the stupidity of it
Im sorry

Because of the sign
Three months.
Four months.
Eight months?
Eleven months.

Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. Thats just...
Why is Packer back?

Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing
Nice. You know
Do I have any say in this?!
Whoa
Why are you nodding?
Well
Yeah.

Thats a lot of reasons!
Can I talk to you a second?
So
Well
I really think we should join forces on this one.
What do we think
Here we go.
Youve gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers
Okay! Well this isnt my best
He... Its a crime fighting beaver.
Absolutely
Yeah I couldnt cut it down.
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
using fake Southern accent
It is weird! Look at you
Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
trying to hide from Michael what theyre doing
Hes a jerk.
Wait! Why dont we come up with a plan were all happy about?
Oh
How did those get out? Im sorry.
I was in Jamaica
Probably
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfields Miracle Legumes.
Im really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
Theyre legumes Dwight
Shes amazing. This is very exciting.
Thats a guarantee.
Dont think you need the corpse then.
At a gas station.
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Totally reasonable.
Cause its a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Yeah... it.s scary.
Not bad right.
Nice.
Oh my God.
It is right. I mean
Theyre probably worthless.
Leave the telescope.
Holly
Congratulations!
Wait
We made that.
Yeah
Alright
And what happens here is-
We were... I think she was just trying to-
Wait
Listen
Hey
Thank you very much.
Were back in! Right?
Yep
Okay.
No she doesnt wa- Shes not here.
Stay in bed!
Having a great time.
Thanks
Why dont you just
I just dont understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me
Whos gonna see us?
Get in the car?
I think Im gonna go.
I think you got this. Kay?   Alright. Feel better!
Im sorry

Nope
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh
I dont know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I dont know
Didnt I?
I gotta go do this.
I dont know that we need to dissect it all now
That did. Pretty huge laugh.
And impressions!
You gotta play along man.
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Hey! Its almost your last day
You sure?
Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Michael walks into the office
Uhh
Hey
So Ive been meaning to tell ya
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch
Youre not leaving tomorrow. Youre leaving today right?
Wow
Absolutely not. Its just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
And then tomorrow
Alright.
Listen Michael
I will see you
You got it.
Hey!
No he doesnt. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Every time theres a silence
Careful. There is no inner circle.
There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things
Thats Toys R Us
Uh oh
Seriously?
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Hes good at his job. And I like working for him.
And say what? Hey Deangelo
Mmm-hmm.
Hey
Umm
If its alright
I know.   Just the guys. Well
Maybe theres a vibe out there
Whoa. Whoa. Wait.
Oh. Like nobody.
It was --
Thats awesome.
Hey
Oh yeah
He didnt text me.
Dont worry
Yeah.
Nope. Just...   Okay.
Well
So this is my life. Until I win the lottery  . Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
You know what? Instead of a game
Today. Now
Why not?
Alright
15 feet from the baseline
Okay.
Fantastic.
Yup.
Now what?
Oh my God
Erin.
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates
Nope. Baskets have it.
So as it turns out
Well
Wait...
Im coming.
Youd slow me down.
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Lets see
Question
You define foment.
Oh
Nope. Social club. God
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately
Wow
And the desk.
Okay.
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word
You cant fire me. Youre acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
You wouldnt dare.
If you get promoted
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager
Oh
Nope. When Jos here

Well
Yep.
Hey
Well
He never called a meeting.
Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Really?
...What is it?
You could just be saying it to get the job.
How about this. Why dont you give us a part of the plan
Okay.
Did you just trademark that...
We are the Search Committee
Unfortunately
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Can you...  seems intimidated
Yes.
Yes.
He creeps me out.   But
Jim and Gabe laugh
Well
So I think all we need is a resume
Yeah
Can I ask why youre leaving your current job?
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Andy? You all set?
So
Is it?
Your departments just you
Good!
Yeah.
Peepa.
Great.
No.
Youre not getting an interview
Okay. Thats vivid.
Yikes.
Well
Unfortunately
Okay.
Thank you.
Great.
Im sure its fine.
Howard Cline?
Oh... Deshaun Williams.
Hes an amazing man. Hes a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys.
Thats very interesting. Um
I think thats probably all we need to hear from...
Thats very...
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
No
Uh--
Okay
No
Oh
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
What is it?
Oh
No. No! Wait
Ohhhh!
This guy was good. Although
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Um... why Kelly?
Okay.
Oh
No.
You know
All right. Name.
Thank you
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
All right
Yes.
Thank you
Well
Hes not a real candidate.
You took the deal.
Thats not okay.
What is happening right now?
No
Okay.   Okay
No
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like Im going a little bit crazy.
Thank you.
Okay
I suppose I am.
Yes.
Okay.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What about Darryl? We can all agree that hes a stand-up guy
What? No
I dont know. This conversation really got away from me.
No
The Search Committee finally decided
Oh
No
No one should be planking at all.
You watching that commercial again?   Why do you keep watching it
Hes got a bank vault. Thats a start.
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break
Can I call you right back? Thank you very much.   Okay.   What is this?
Its
Its just a list of our names
Okay
No. Okay. Um
We dont need a warning signal
I promise you
Left.
Why are you- How do you know?
Uh
Okay
I dont think its-
Thats not it.
Mmum
Wait
Alright
Hey. Its nothing. Alright? Ill text you when we get there. Let you know whats going on.
Nope. No dog video.
Okay. See you guys.
Uhhh
Oh
Right.
Yeah
Well
Shhh.
Alright
Hey
Alright.
Hey Kev
Yeah
Does it save time though? ‘Cause weve been here for about an hour.
K
No
How many L to a K?
Ill take five.
Your ex-wife?
Wow. Alright. Cant wait to meet her.
Hey.  Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jims desk
Why dont you start?
He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
New leads
She looks at it when shes on the potty
We know that.
You have a walking buddy.
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
But
I dont know
Thats pretty good. What about uh
Alright
Wait. You did say we could pool our points
I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much.   Uh
Ok.
Andrew.
No
I dont know what to tell you
Oh
Nah
Yeah. Big sale. Dont worry about it though
and Im back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in
Gettin psyched up?
Andy
I mean
But I think its big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea....which
Absolutely not.
Pull up your pants.
Do Snowboarders hate animals?
Dwight! At least aim it.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Alright! Nice job
So...ah
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Oscar
Yeah
Nice job.
Oh man
I mean
No
Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
Which ideally would be me....
Stop. Im a barista in your fantasy?
I dont know about Stephen King
Uh
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. Thats seventy-five boxes per person
Nice.   Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
Theres gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
Yeah   Not that theyre not smart people.
Id go with that.
Not that
Its a great idea Kev
Our fake winnings
It is
Nope. Youre
A...hot chocolate tea
Kevin Costner.
Yeah.
So
But
So sadly
Is he OK?
OK
Thats alright.
Doesnt matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein
Thats OK
Porque es muy rapido.
Right. Its city and country combined.
And I can fish right from the window of Pams pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
But what are you gonna do about that?
Hey. So
Youve seen it
Theres this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If theres an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape
Okay
Ah
So
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean
Im actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing.   Ive only sold one copy.
Chapter 2 – Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed
Oh
No.
No
Chapter 4 – One of the hosts most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
Chapter 9 – The tableau vivant is not only welcomed
Closing ceremonies.
I think I left my wallet in your house.
Right here.
Keys
I didnt forget them
Im so sorry
Whoo.
Hey
I dont know if I can.
Alright.
I know
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
Hey.
Oh
Was it
Mmhmm. No
Yeah
Hey its Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because Ive read a lot about this really great documentary.
Its called Ghostbusters.
It didnt have a buster sign around him? Why dont you draw him? Why dont we see this whole thing.
I aint fraid of no ghost.   Whoa!
You know thats...
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Party looks fun doesnt it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
Are you serious?
Thats funny. Ok.
Thank you.
Careful
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. Its not...
Thank you.
Like
Ok.
Oh
...W R K.
Uh no its W R K
Im just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derbys in a really good place now. So...my pitch is...me
Is that off again?
Ok.
Wait
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
Dwight
If this doomsday device goes off...
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
Ok.
Nope.
Hmm...Heda.   No.
Ok
Ill try both.
Robert.
Yeah
You up for a game?
Exactly. Here we go. Lets do it.
Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
In the box.
Is that my phone?
Nah
Oh
Yes. Right now? Yes.
Here you go.
Awww
You sure?
What kinda iPhone is that?
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
Ha ha. No
hits ball
Im alright.
Yep.
Yep. Ah. Oh.
Yeah. That does not feel good.
Hmm. Doubt it.
Whats that?
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured wed save her from Ryan right?
Hey.
Yeah. Super pretty.
The temp?
Nope.
And Im telling you
No
No
Okay. Uh
Oh
Oh
Mm-hmm.
Not his moms car.
Touche?
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test
Dwight!
Dwight! Dwight!
Sorry about that.
Dwight!   Why?
Leave.
Mm-hmm?
Told you.
You okay?
Okay
Stop shoving me.
Really?
Si.
Okay
Oh
No
No.
I am not lying.
Pam
Yeah
I dont know.
Okay
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh okay
Okay.
Oh my God!
Okay guys
How do you feel?
Cool. Thanks.
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials
No
By the way
Yeah
Only two hundred dollars?
Oh wow. So thats two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Yeah sorry everyone else didnt come. I think theyre just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery.
What are you talking about?
Andy – this whole idea of our situation being just like war? Its just not true. We just work at a paper company. And youre our regional manager. And guess what man? You dont have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you dont believe me take a look at whats on my head. Im wearing a very pink hat. Ive been getting weird looks all day because Im pretty sure DM does GB means something kinda sexual. But guess whos wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. Thats huge.
Theyre terrible.
Hey guys lets just all admit it. Ok? Dwights better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And hes never
What are you up to? Oops look out!
Prank!
You know what its not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Because youre sitting?
Ok.
Because youre sitting?
You know I have to do this.
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
I dont know. He wasnt talking to me. But if I were you I wouldnt hire his wife.
Well its sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Well its not that easy. Its kind of sometimes difficult.
No
Oh
Very cute.
Oh wait
Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.   Creed. I was never here
Oh boy.
Do I?
I know
I really wish I could help. Im not really sure how I can...
Thats the thing. See
Perfect!
Yes?
I dont know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest
Yes. All right. Great.
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
Shes not your grandmother
Yeah.
It wasnt me.
Kathy wants to leave our clump?
Ow
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
What was that?
Cant do that.
Ah...  Im gonna s-
Dwight really wants my bonus. Hes trying to entrap me. Oh god
Uh
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers
I wonder
Hmm...
Nice try
Three times.
Andy
OK
Yes
Uh
And whats its name?
Oops.
Hey guys
Yes. It is.
I know
I dont-
Yeah.
O...K.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep
Right. Youre right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Ill figure it out
You alright
Yes.
Two friends who are not sleeping together
OK.
Alright. I will definitely do that.
You know what? Youre sitting
Yes. They totally do.
Oh man
All right
Okay
All right
You can write a book about chairs.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that dont know what paper is.
Stop right there. I love it.
In Philadelphia.
Thats a great idea.
Yeah.
All right
I thought it was a fun idea.
Okay.
Theres a table over here.
Shawn Marion.
Wrong
Oh my God. Lamar Odom
All right.
Its always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that shes out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error
I know.
Whoa
You know
Im sorry
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Youre looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is
Robert
I bet I should.   Thats beautiful
All right-
I must...
Robert
Really? Why?
Good night.
To both these bears.
To madness.
Hey
Are you serious?
And theres my talking point.
Hey.
Okay.
Yeah.
It was pretty uneventful
Uh
Nope. Not guilty.
Were best friends
Okay.
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon
Aw man
Mine was actually a pretty boring case
Wow
I never considered that my week off would make everyone elses job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
So Phyllis
Oh man
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Okay
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasnt listening to you.
...and Pam was just going crazy
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
No.
No.
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Uh-
The empanada guy!
Uh
Because my car broke down.
Well
Okay
Uh
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
Pam really needed some help with the kids
You want a giraffe?
Yes
Whoa
Whoa
Split the difference?
Okay
What?
Wow
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
That was a great idea.
Oh my goodness
Oh
You know what? I dont think you need to do things on command. Thats very weird. Ill just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show
I dont know what else we can do here.
Its okay.
All right
All right
I know
Oh bud
Cece!
Okay
I know
Im gonna grab her
Hi
No
Thanks guys. All right
Oh ho! Look whos back reporting for duty.
Nope. Its over.
Nope. OK.
Ooh
I just got a text from Robert California that says bring your clubs to Florida.
I hope not.   Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Robert
Got your text
Yeah
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
Robert
Ok
Really did   He responded L-O-L.
Now
I think youre right.
Total nightmare.
Yeah
You know Dwight
Hold on
Essential.
Alright
Well
Hey
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
Mosquito.
So
That sounds awesome.
Dwight
Bye.
I will.
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so Im up and at em at four fifteen
Puppet.
Yeah. Its weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Are you sure its stress? Because I did poison you.
Oh no
Thats a good one.   Whoa
Yes.
Loggins and Messina.
Man.
Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
I would love to hear the other mottos.
No way.
It was-
You got to stop with the antacids. Its not the antidote.
Okay.
True loves kiss.
Dwight
Wow. Are you that bored?
Is that another motto?
Mmm.
Ah
Ive spent so much of my life telling myself Please
Oh
All right
Dwight
No ones moving!
Wha- no. No
The one thing Pam made sure I knew
Dwight
You havent done any of the research.
Stanley
You are bleeding through your shirt.
Catching butterflies.
Theater.
Dragging.
Dragging sticks.
Talla-nasty
Cathy? Its been great. Fun
How many buttons do you have?
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Alright
Hey
Uh... yeah
Okay.
Oh
Yes
Yup
We have plenty.
Do you want to watch the game with us? Were watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
No
Stanley. Stanley.
Stanley. Uhh... you know what? Just bring back those bottles!

In the bed.
Brown

Yeah.
I know.
Ow.
Just check it.
Alright.
He knows what hes doing.
Alright
Oh.
I dont know
Well

You know what? Maybe they just ate.
Okay
Is that really how you want to get this job?
Okay
Hmm? No.
Okay alright.   Im really sorry
um... I mean-
Im sorry
Yes

All right. Now I think its time for you to go.
Cathy
Awesome.
Right there!
Oh
Nice job

Oh yeah? Whats the first best?
Is that Nellie?
Which Spice Girl?
Okay.
Come on
Yeah
Uh
Im very sorry.
Im really sorry. Is there anything I can do
Yeah. Yeah
Dwight.
You can...   You can do it Ryan.
Youre the only one who can do it
I thought it was great
About ten minutes.
Oops
Its Ryan. Im sorry. I lied. Im not in the bathroom. I cant do it. I need to see my mom. Im going home.
Uh...
okay.
Im not doing the Presentation.
Okay
A costume?
Ive been in here for 20 seconds.
Im not wearing eyeliner.
Time. Space. Gender.   There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love
This... is the future
When I was ten years old
Oh.
All right.  Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night!
Yeah.  Thank you. Thank you.
Oh
This is the last time Ill ever see Dwight. Its a weird feeling
All right. So... I guess this is it.
Goodbye
Well
Whats that?
I thought you liked the store?
Thank you.
Wow. When you put it that way
All right. There he is.
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
Um
You know
Well
No
I tried. He will not listen.
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look
Stanleys very upset that were leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
OK. All right.
Dwight.
OK
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
Dwight
And then
Yes.
Dwight
OK
Dwight
Gross! Dont lick my hand! God
Gross!
What? What
Im sorry.
Im so sorry
You all right? You ok?
What are you doing?
Get up.
Get up. All right? Im not gonna let you by.
OK.   What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesnt work.
What are you doing? No. No
This is dangerous.
Why?
Nope. I think that was it.
Yeah
Hey.
I missed you.
Wow. Its the end of an era.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
Nellie
What brings you to town?
No
Cant you do something about this?
-Right.
What is going on? And wheres Andy? And what is going on?
I think its a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo
Any luck?
Andy?
Andy
What? Youre in Florida? Andy
Like
Guys
Dwight
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever?
The raise isnt real.
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Yeah. She gave one to Dwight
Land. World. Uh
Yes.
Oh

Was that not the--
Mm-hm.
Was that it? No
No. I wouldve said no.
I mean
No
Yeah
Yes.
No.
She dies.
Lets see it. Show of hands.
All right
How?
Oh
Stanley doesnt have a moustache.
Okay
Okay
Who says no moustache?  Jim
Im sorry
Why is she here?
Nellie
That was one time-
Excuse me
Ah
Thats moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Sounds like every other party.
Oh! Hire a magician.
Trust me.
Yes
Nellie
I doubt that theyre sh-
Whoa. Who is this guy?
Boyfriend.
Like a boyfriend?
Yeah. Whoa. Heres one with his face whited out.
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Oh
Shh!
Dwight!
Im so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
No
You know what
No
Absolutely. Yeah.   Call it off
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most
No. No.
Oh
Ill do it.
Its the four of hearts.
Not true. Cause thats not a real place.
Well
Night-night.
Phyllis says the same twelve clichés every time it rains. So
Hey
And thats noon. Exactly.
Thats it.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh

You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couples counseling.
No
Thats all right.
So how does it work? Its like
Mm-hmm.
If I didnt do certain things without telling Pam
If she can just hang on for a little while longer
What do you mean?
Thats kind of an impossible question.
Well
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Yes
Mmhm.
Oh

Okay. The annex it is. Ill be sitting at your desk if thats okay with you.
Hey
Oh
I get it.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies
I really felt like I almost lost her
Again.

If you could help me out
Anything would help.

Im sure you did not. What was your question?
Well
Look whos back.
Weeknights are actually tough just because—
Thats true
Congratulations
So.
Lets hear it.

Dont get me wrong
Oh

What kind of offer?
What?
Oh
Wow
Yeah
Oh
This
I know. And I cant do it.
Sales form for you to sign.
Aw
No.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
All depends on the conference room meeting itself.   Uh
Yeah.
I will. I will.
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf
He welcomes you.
Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Lets not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak
Yes
Thats obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Gotta write that down. Ok
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy—
My god
Potential future nonsense.
Im gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. Youve got a regional manager.
Obviously
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Exactly.
Yeah
Well
Nothing.
Members of the office
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure
He envies you.
Alright.
By 2:00
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith
985
Okay
Oh
Thats exactly what I was doing. Plop
Ew
Come on.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna—
Challenge number two
Do you want a corn dog?
Well see. You are an assistant whos just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight
Uncanny.
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees
Yeah. Its real. Its the only way youll learn. OK
Look at that form.
Uncanny.
You know
What Im about to say makes no logical sense
Is-
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet
Hey.
You all right? Whats going on?
Yes
Yeah.
What?
Pam.
This was my decision
You didnt force me.
You did not force me to do this.
I dont know how else to tell you.
Resent you?
Is that really what you think?
Not enough? I dont know how else to explain it to her
You threw the summoning bag at me
Perform a test.
Ooh
Unless you think he cant handle it.
All right.
Thank you.
Well Ive been trying to tell you how I feel
OK
I have an assistant now
Ok
What do we got?
Wow! Congratulations
Right in the sweet spot. I think youre gonna be really happy.
Thats a lot of pros.
So what is the problem?
I dont know what you want me to tell you
Love.
Dwight
Not as good as you.
You got it.
You watched it.
Well
Its from the teapot. Everything youll ever need to know is in that note.   Not enough for me? You are everything.
Here we go.
Umm....
I bike to work now. Saves on gas
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Okay
Uh
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. Hes putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years Ive done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight...only good surprises. Guten Pranken.
Okay
Mose has been weird? Thats so unlike him.
Hey man
Hey!
Kismet? Yeah
And Jim will say nothing.
Yeah?
Wow! That sounds incredible.  . Oh
Get out.
No
Of course I did.
Yeah!   Guten Prank number two.
Private Room.
Enjoy
Okay
Hey
Oh
They think it was Mose.
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub youd ever set foot in in this town?
Mm
Is that Mose?
Ooh.
Nope
Okay
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrows his wedding day. You cant be anything but happy on your wedding day.
Yes
Hey. Hey
Right.
Am I the only one thats nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Doesnt seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so thats fine.
O-Kay.
Um
You ready?
Dwight
The minister just told me that its tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
I havent heard of it
I think its definitely... Well
Either way
I just...really wish there was something I could do.
Best prank ever.
See
I gotta get out of this dress.
Whats going on?
No
Sorry
Thats why its so clean.
I mean
Oh... okay. Where would we go?
I promise you
The last...
Hold on a second.   The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about...
You wanna do this?
You really want to do this?
Oh my God!
Hey
Lets go outside
You know what? Maybe we should talk.
Athleap.
Dwight
Hey
There it is.
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes...and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love
Thanks Phyl.
