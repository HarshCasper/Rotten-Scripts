### Create a Word Cloud

Takes any file as input, preprocesses the content by removing stopwords, creates a wordcloud out of them and saves this wordcloud as a PNG.

##### Steps

- Installation
  1. Using pip

     ```
     pip install wordcloud
     ```

  2. Download the .whl compatible with your Python version and your Windows distribution (32bit or 64bit) from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#wordcloud)
     cd to the file path
     ```
     python -m pip install <filename>
     ```

> Note: If pip doesn't install the wheel, it's probably because you're using 32bit Python. I would suggest using 64bit python for which there is a wheel.

- Using the script
  1. To get a basic wordcloud
     ```
     python create_word_cloud.py --text <filename>
     ```
  2. To get a wordcloud with a specific background
     ```
     python create_word_cloud.py --text <filename> --background <color>
     ```
  3. To get a wordcloud in the shape of a mask

     ```
     python create_word_cloud.py --text <filename> --mask <filename>
     ```

     > Note: Keep in mind that the background of the mask used must be white, otherwise, the system will consider the background as an object. In addition, the background cannot be transparent, because transparent colors will be considered black.

  4. To get a border of the mask with the wordcloud

     ```
     python create_word_cloud.py --text <filename> --contour_width <integer>
     ```

     > Note: This will need a mask. Also, the default color is black.

  5. To get a colored border of the mask with the wordcloud

     ```
     python create_word_cloud.py --text <filename> --contour_color <color>
     ```

     > Note: This will need a mask and a contour width.

  6. To get a wordcloud in the colors based on the mask

     ```
     python create_word_cloud.py --text <filename> --color_func 1
     ```
  You can also use all of the flags together, like this:
  ```
  python create_word_cloud.py --text <filename> --background <color> --mask <filename> --contour_width <integer> --contour_color <color> --color_func 1
  ```
