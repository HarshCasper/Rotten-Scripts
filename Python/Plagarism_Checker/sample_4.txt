If you don’t have a lot of space for a garden, raised beds can be a great option.
 Gardening in mixed beds is a great way to get the most productivity from a small area. Some
 investment is required. You’ll need to purchase materials for the raised beds themselves, as well as soil
 and compost.
The investment will pay off, though, in the form of increased productivity.
