The following code sample demonstrates how to use the pg module to connect to a PostgreSQL database. 
Replace USERNAME with the PostgreSQL database username, PASSWORD with the database user's password,

This example creates a Connection object that opens the PostgreSQL database using the specified parameters. 
Once you have a Connection object associated with the database,you can query the database directly using raw 
SQL statements (in this case, a SELECT query on a table named employee)
