# Object Detection
 In this project I have used Python , OpenCV and Numpy to detect objects in images as well as in videos. To get an idea of it, download the  files and follow the setup instructions .
 The output consists of colored lines drawn around objects present in the image(as is attached below).
  
## Dependency

* OpenCV
* Numpy
* Jupyter and associated packages.
