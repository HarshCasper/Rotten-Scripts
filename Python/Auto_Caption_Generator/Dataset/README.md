# Dataset

We have used Flickr8k Dataset for training and testing.

The Dataset comprises 2 directories:

1. Flickr8k_Dataset: Contains 8092 photographs in JPEG format.
1. Flickr8k_text: Contains a number of files containing different sources of descriptions for the photographs.

The dataset has a pre-defined training dataset (6,000 images),
development dataset (1,000 images), and test dataset (1,000 images).

A big shout out to [Jason Brownlee](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets) for providing
us with so many datasets at one place.
