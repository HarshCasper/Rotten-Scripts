# Pagespeed_API

This self explanatory script, uses [Pagespeed_API](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started).
It can be used to - 

- Measure the performance of a web page. (Achieved in this Script)
- Improve accessibility, and SEO. (Out of Scope)

## Setup instructions and Guidelines

This setup has only one requirement, `request`. Usually it is auto-downloaded with other packages.

If that's not the case `pip  install request` will do the job.

Further more, the script requires a separate `pagespeed.txt.` file (Name can be changed).
This file is supposed to contain a list of urls, which are to be measured using the API.

The script has proper comments which should be followed. The script is easy to use.

## Output
