Pagespeed_API
=============

|checkout|

This self explanatory script, uses `Pagespeed_API <https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started>`__. It can be used to -

-  Measure the performance of a web page. (Achieved in this Script)
-  Improve accessibility, and SEO. (Out of Scope)

Setup instructions and Guidelines
---------------------------------

This setup has only one requirement, ``request``. Usually it is
auto-downloaded with other packages.

If thatâ€™s not the case ``pip  install request`` will do the job.

Further more, the script requires a separate ``pagespeed.txt.`` file
(Name can be changed). This file is supposed to contain a list of urls,
which are to be measured using the API.

The script has proper comments which should be followed. The script is
easy to use.

Output
------
