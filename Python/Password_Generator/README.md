# Password Generator
We will be creating a project for generating password but not the simple one, this project will generate unique and strong password i.e. these passwords will include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

The library used in this project is-

#### random

The `random` package provides a Python 3 ported version of Python 2.7â€™s `random` module. It has also been back-ported to work in Python 2.6.

In Python 3, the implementation of `randrange()` was changed, so that even with the same seed you get different sequences in Python 2 and 3. Note that several high-level functions such as `randint()` and `choice()` use `randrange()`

### Installation
Install the library using `pip` command in any terminal

```python
pip install random
```

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
