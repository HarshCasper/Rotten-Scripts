Medium is a treasure trove of knowledge. It is a great place to read and
write blogs

Through this script, the contents of a medium article can be downloaded
and stored

The script is written in Python

The Beautiful Soup library in Python enables web scraping and enables
parsing though html content, which web pages are made of. Here, the same
has been used.

Implementation
--------------

The user is prompted to enter the URL of the Medium article that has to
be downloaded
