Cartoonified Image
==================

Computer Vision as we know is a very powerful tool with immense
possibilities. So, why not to use it? Here, I have implemented a script
that will read the original image and convert the original image into
cartoonified image. The original image is converted into cartoonified
image as well as there is an another approach by using
``cv2.stylization()``

Results:
--------

Original Image
