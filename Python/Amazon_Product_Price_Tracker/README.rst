====================

|checkout|

-  This script built in Python is an Amazon Price Tracker.
-  The user enters :

   -  The URL of the product of which he would like to track of the price.
   -  His/Her budget for the product.
   -  His/Her Email credentials.

-  The script runs continuously and checks on the price of the product every 12 hours.
-  If the price of the product is equal to or below the userâ€™s budget, the user receives an email confirmation.
-  The price of the product is logged into a file named price_logger.txt every 12 hours.

Working and Usage
-----------------

-  The BeautifulSoup library is used to scrape the price of the product from the Amazon site.
-  On Amazon, the prices of products are either expressed as a range or as a single number.

-  If the budget is within the range, an email will be sent.
-  In the script, headers need to be used to make the get request to the Amazon site.
-  In place of headers, the user must replace it with the result of **my user agent** must be used instead.
