# Quantum random number generation
This python script explains how classical computations can be done using Quantum gates. It generates a random number using Quantum computation.

### How to use?

- Intially register at [IBM quantum computing](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) 

- Go to my account section located in top-right where you will find your credentials and information on how to run Qiskit package locally.

- Additionally, I have included a section in comments for you to save your account. I recommend to setup a virtual environment for it, so you can easily uninstall packages if you do not want to use them further.
