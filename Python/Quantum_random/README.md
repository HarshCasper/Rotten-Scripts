# Quantum random number generation
This python script explains how classical computations can be done using Quantum gates. It generates a random number using Quantum computation.

### How to use?

Intially register at [IBM quantum computing](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) go to my account where you will find your credentials and information on how to run Qiskit package locally. 
Additionally, I have included a section in comments for you to save your account. I recommend to setup a virtual environment for it, so you can easily uninstall packages if you do not want to use them further.

### Just type in:

`python Quant_random.py`

### Requirements
In case you want to setup a virtual environment. Read [this](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

Before running the script, just install qiskit for python using this command:

`pip install qiskit`

> Happy Quantuming.
