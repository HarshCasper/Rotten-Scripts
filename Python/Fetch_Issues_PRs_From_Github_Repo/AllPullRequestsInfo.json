The code <em>may</em> still work, and\nnon-invasive patches to keep it working will be considered. However, more\nmodern tools no longer support old Node.js versions making testing difficult.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Removed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BREAKING</strong>: Remove <code>util.getPath</code>, <code>util.setPath</code>, and <code>util.deletePath</code>.\n<code>util.setPath</code> had a potential prototype pollution security issue when used\nwith unsafe inputs. These functions are not used by <code>forge</code> itself. They date\nfrom an early time when <code>forge</code> was targeted at providing general helper\nfunctions. The library direction changed to be more focused on cryptography.\nMany other excellent libraries are more suitable for general utilities. If\nyou need a replacement for these functions, consier <code>get</code>, <code>set</code>, and <code>unset</code>\nfrom <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">lodash</a>. But also consider the potential similar\nsecurity issues with those APIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.9.2 - 2020-09-01</h2>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>util.setPath</code> security note to function docs and to README.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SECURITY</strong>: The <code>util.setPath</code> function has the potential to cause\nprototype pollution if used with unsafe input.\n<ul>\n<li>This function is <strong>not</strong> used internally by <code>forge</code>.</li>\n<li>The rest of the library is unaffected by this issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not</strong> use unsafe input with this function.</li>\n<li>Usage with known input should function as expected. (Including input\nintentionally using potentially problematic keys.)</li>\n<li>No code changes will be made to address this issue in 0.9.x. The current\nbehavior <em>could</em> be considered a feature rather than a security issue.\n0.10.0 will be released that removes <code>util.getPath</code> and <code>util.setPath</code>.\nConsider <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> from <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">lodash</a> if you need\nreplacements. But also consider the potential similar security issues with\nthose APIs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODEFORGE-598677\">https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODEFORGE-598677</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7720\">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7720</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/8018c3ea6f8e75d2df1b9ce4ec9c536db3db37e6\"><code>8018c3e</code></a> Release 0.10.0.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/6a1e3ef74f6eb345bcff1b82184201d1e28b6756\"><code>6a1e3ef</code></a> Remove object path functions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/30d560c6b522b9a97a67d9101ecf8f860a4ba63a\"><code>30d560c</code></a> Remove Node.js 4 support.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/1ba83ecca436c2e1d0d37ea154467e9934019504\"><code>1ba83ec</code></a> Update dependencies.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/81abd87a9a8ef705af17d1e712a086ef4b7869a1\"><code>81abd87</code></a> Improve linting.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/7b59028142bb5f5e299df0d0931a8306d7d7046b\"><code>7b59028</code></a> Test on Node.js 14.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/ba13a1c8bfdb1d6abb286fa7fcb82a57b40ae345\"><code>ba13a1c</code></a> Update webpack.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/c8d5395e078f838604eb9df32ef9d298288057fd\"><code>c8d5395</code></a> Add travis browser test names.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/afc5a728f5c6bf5cb80eddb5b85c7340b28bfa51\"><code>afc5a72</code></a> Update dependencies.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/ba0207fa359f79a5af0e71d12f488a846e9265f6\"><code>ba0207f</code></a> Test on Node.js 12.</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/compare/0.9.1...0.10.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=node-forge&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=0.9.1&new-version=0.10.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/configuring-github-dependabot-security-updates)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
