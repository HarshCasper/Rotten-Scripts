This script can provide much value for implementing such feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\n\r\nThe must-have features: Spell Checking, logging the mistaken words etc.\r\nGood to have features: Grammatical mistakes also checked and suggests changes.\r\n\r\nNot needed to change those words in the file. As the first iteration, just logging/telling the use where one can improve and what to improve can be a good start. Make sure the line numbers are logged along as well. There are various `npm` packages and python Libs available for doing this. \r\n\r\nThough, it is not limited to this. Would love to discuss how and what can be done.

Please describe.**: \r\n\r\nI'm always frustrated when I need to denoise a number of audio files at once. One needs to first extract each audio file from videos, then create a noise profile separately for each audio file and export them separately after this process.\r\nThe whole job takes me more than an hour for 5-7 audio files.  Below is the solution that I propose to this problem.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**: \r\nThe solution is to automate the process of extraction, creating a noise profile for each audio file separately and then de-noise it and also export it. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes for 10+ audio files, which will be a huge improvement.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n_________________________________________________THESE ARE COMMENTS____________________________________________________\r\n\r\nDid you type your name in assignees column.\r\nTry commenting </assign> (Without the angular brackets) after all the checks have completed.\r\nRemember YOU NEED TO ADD YOUR github handle in THE ASSIGNEE  for this to work\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n-->\r\n",

Maybe ask for language from the participants themselves?\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, a proper hotfix would be made soon as well, to fix these problems asap.\r\n",

Idea is to make this Script handy for the people investing in Stock Market. Moreover, this script isn't limited to just this idea. On Brain storming an amalgamation of multiple APIs to serve a specific need can also be extended. Eg. Along with Stock Market, we also provide updates for Rupee value, Gold rate etc. which can be extremely handy for the traders. \r\n\r\n## Language\r\n\r\n\r\n- [X] Javascript\r\n- [X] Python\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- **Details on the Script**\r\n\r\n\r\n| name            | about                                                  | labels  | assignees                                                      |\r\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Slack Notifier | Real Time Notifier Slack Bot that keeps the user updated for Stock Market Prices  | feature | self-assign if you want to work on this issue else leave blank |\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**: A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n\r\n[SLACK API](https://api.slack.com/) provides various functionalities for implementing this feature. IMO, webhooks can be a simpler way for this; though many other ways are available for the implementation.\r\n\r\nThird Party APIs are required for fetching the Real Time Stock Market Price Update for a particular stock or multiple. Can keep that variable. Also, according to the opinions and creativity from the assignee for this feature, other APIs can be appended. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nThis is a good issue to work on if you wanna explore SLACK API. Slack integration is highly used in various applications such as ChatBots, Analytics etc. tools in order to track and interract with the users on the fly.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want to work on this. First, before assignment; would love to know what will be your work flow and overall clarity on implementation. Would love to work closely with the assignees for this particular task!\r\n",

And of course, this is not limited to just conversion, but on top of it some good use-cases can be added as examples, that can be good.\r\n\r\nThis can be a good script to work on for beginners.

We can connect over social media channels as well, so Open Source is all about meeting awesome people and making important connections.\r\n\r\nDuring this coming tenure of 3 months, we would focus on these fundamental objectives:\r\n\r\n- Dead code/Bounty Hunting.\r\n- Improve Documentation.\r\n- Developing and enhancing our very own Static Website.\r\n- Awesome scripts in multiple languages.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other ideas, features or a recommendation, we welcome you to start a discussion over [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts/discussions) or on our official channels (links to be posted soon).\r\n\r\nWe follow a specific workflow here at Rotten-Scripts:\r\n\r\n- Search for issues that are `open-for-all`, i.e. No Assignees. OR Open an issue.\r\n- Wait till the issue is assigned to you.\r\n- **Only after** the issue is assigned to you, start working, we would be waiting for the Pull Request.\r\n- Open the PR, every **Pull Request requires a review** from Maintainers and Admin. (It can take some time).\r\n- Make changes if required. \r\n- And _voila_, your would-be merged asap.\r\n- Important: Kindly ensure that the issue assigned to you has `GSSoC'21` label, if not ask the maintainers to do the same.\r\n\r\nHere are some important documents, that we strongly request you to read:\r\n\r\n- [CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [STYLING GUIDELINES](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts/blob/master/STYLE_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [PYTHON GUIDE](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts/blob/master/Python/CONTRIBUTION-GUIDELINE.md)\r\n\r\nFinally, here are **must-follow** some rules:\r\n\r\n- **Be Nice, Be Respectful** (BNBR)\r\n- **Check** if the Issue you created, exists or not.\r\n- Make **proper commit messages** and document your PR well.\r\n- Always **add Comments** in your Code and explain it at points.\r\n- **Dynamic Input is always preferred** over static Driver Code.\r\n- **Squash your commits** before you push them.\r\n- Always create a Pull Request from a Branch; **Never from the Master**.\r\n- Follow proper Code conventions. Using` i`, `j` in Loops shows a poor understanding of Code Quality. **Use proper Variable, Function Names**.\r\n- Issues would be served on **First Come, First Serve** basis.\r\n- Issues would be tagged as `Level0`, `Level1`, `Level2` & `Level3`. Scores would be assigned on the **difficulty of the Issue you solve**.\r\n- Code would be reviewed by Mentors before they are merged. **Every PR requires 3 Reviews**.\r\n\r\n<b>Regards,</b>\r\n<i>Harsh Mishra (@harshcasper), Project Administrator</i> \r\n<i>Vybhav Chaturvedi (@vybhav72954 ), Project Maintainer</i>\r\n<i>Soham Shah ( @sohamsshah ), Project Miantainer</i>\r\n<i>Seema Saharan ( @seema1711 ), Project Maintainer</i>\r\n\r\nHappy Coding \ud83e\udd17\r\n",

            "Body": "## Description \r\n\r\nRotten Scripts traditionally hosts scripts around Python, Javascript and Golang. It comes as a no surprise since these languages have a community centered around them, with some awesome packages and libraries for almost every development needs. \r\n\r\nHowever, since we are looking at things from a more diverse point of view, we would love to have scripts in various languages as well. And the one, that tops the list is Rust. And it comes as a no-surprise: Rust is feature-rich, incredible fast and has a lot of interesting components that we can play with. \r\n\r\nSo now the Issue begs: Why don't we have contributors play around with Rust and contribute to the same? \r\n\r\n## Deliverable \r\n\r\nInstead of just creating Issues for Rust, I would like to first gauge the interest of those who would like to contribute towards it. There is no dearth of ideas: Rotten Scripts hosts nearly 200+ Scripts from various domains. You can rework on them using Rust and I have some awesome resources to share as well. \r\n\r\nBut rather than creating an Issue, I would like to have a proposal: The proposal should document your experience with Rust (Its fine if you don't have any) and the list of scripts that you would like to work on. Prepare a Markdown proposal and post on the [Discussions](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts/discussions) and tag me. \r\n\r\nOnce we have a nice discussion about the deliverable, I will create a project board and you can start working on the same. \r\n\r\n## Resources \r\n\r\n- [Starting Rust From A Scripting Background](https://rust-from-a-scripting-background.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\r\n- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)",

Some of the contributors started contributing Jupyter Notebooks as well, in a bid to have a better visualization for the scripts that they wrote. It not only enhanced the understanding for a user but for scripts that relied on AI/ML, it gave a better insight into the functionality.\r\n\r\nHowever, Jupyter Notebooks are notorious to have a lot of metadata associated with the files. And now with a lot of Notebooks, there are a lot of metadata and it has inflated the lines of code so much, that the project is now classified in `Jupyter Notebook` category. \r\n\r\nThis behaviour can be fixed, by adding a  `*.ipynb linguist-vendored` to the `.gitattributes` file.",

I want to better understand on how easy has the contributions been for the Contributors. \r\n\r\nSince the Project has been a part of many Open-Source Programs, I need to understand how many PRs have been merged and how many PRs were closed. You can also scrap the comments and use some NLP techniques, to determine the most common reasons why PRs were closed and whether they were done by me or the contributor themselves. \r\n\r\nI'm open to new ideas, but this is what the workflow should look like: \r\n\r\n- Scrap PRs from the Project \r\n- Store all of them in a neat CSV format \r\n- Use your Data Visualization and NLP skills in churning out necessary insights \r\n- Find the most common reasons on why PRs are closed and by whom \r\n- Check out other stats like Average time for every PR to be reviewed, the most active maintainer and more\r\n- Present all of these findings in the Discussions Tabs \r\n\r\nThe whole thing should be easily reproducible so please make a PR over the `Others` so that we can run the check and churn out stats every couple of months.",

This is because some of the Scripts might have been deprecated because of changing dependencies or because of slacking up in the review purpose. This Issue is `Open for all` who would like to hunt some dead code. \r\n\r\nFeel free to set it up, on your Personal System and install the dependencies accordingly. If you are using Python, prefer to have a virtual environment at the place. If the dependency installation is problematic, feel free to create a report about the same and create an issue for the same. \r\n\r\nApart from that, if a code doesn't seem to work, you can raise an issue for that. Points would be allocated for them as well. If you can fix it, please feel free to create a pull request. \r\n\r\nFew points to note: \r\n\r\n- If you are creating an Issue, add as many details as possible, including some screenshots. \r\n- If you are making a PR, please highlight the breaking change. \r\n- If the script doesn't seem to work in any way, please create an Issue for the same. Someone can remove the original Script and add their changes. \r\n\r\nThis Issue is open for all. Feel free to hunt any dead code and create Issues/PRs. This Issue Thread would serve the purpose of any discussion that we can possibly have.",

And if I look back at the reasons, it might due to some stupid requirements that I put over it in the initial stages. \r\n\r\nOne of them included having Images and GIFs to show the Code Preview or the Script demonstration. As more Scripts were added, this became huge and redundant for us in the longer run. \r\n\r\nThis Issue would require to remove all images from the Project and replace them with Imgur Links.

Go to Any new PR\r\n2. Check if Docstrongs, shebang, EOF are properly formatted or not\r\n3. If not, see the PyLint Action Result\r\n4. No error displayed\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAlthough this is expected, cause the Action was made to be tolerant, it's time we get rid of that, and make it more strict.\r\n\r\n",

Sometimes the subtitles present in those mkv containers would be out of sync and it might be in language which we don't know. So, it would be cool to remove those subtitles and have a clean mkv file with just audio and video.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA single bash script to traverse through the mkv files, remove the subtitles and meta tags and then place the clean mkv files in a separate folder.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n I considered using the MKVToolNixGUI, but when it come to batch removal, we have to manually add and remove each mkv file present in a directory. It was time consuming.\r\n",

            "Body": "Hello @HarshCasper, \r\n\r\nThere are lots of SSGs, some of the most popular are Sphinx, Jekyll, and a lot [more](https://scotch.io/tutorials/top-10-static-site-generators-in-2020). More or less they work on the same principle, that is converting Markdown or reStructured Text into HTML.\r\n\r\nYou may choose any SSG, but Jekyll has an additional advantage that it works natively with gh-pages, no CI/CD required. There are a plethora of themes. As per my experience, I can suggest two ways to create a website for this project.\r\n1. Since every script in this project has a separate readme file. we can just modify them a bit to be included by the site generator recursively (just adding few keywords) and thus site will be generated, you can customize the home page. \r\n2. Create a whole new branch/repo for this purpose and add each script description separately. This gives us slightly more control but it needs huge efforts.\r\n\r\nFor example you can see these:-\r\n- source: https://code.videolan.org/avinal/vlc-android-user generated-site: https://avinal.videolan.me/vlc-android-user (sphinx)\r\n- https://avinal.is-a.dev (pelican)\r\n- https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/ (Jekyll)\r\n",

User can merge lots (as he desire) of PDF's in one go, without wasting any time seeing every page and every PDF. User didn't need to type name of every PDF to merge, he/she can arrange PDF's with a default name with numbers after that.\r\nLike if user want to merge 100 PDF's then he can name PDF's as PDF1,PDF2,PDF3............PDF100, and the code will merge them in one go and need not require naming every PDF in code to merge.\r\n\r\nFixes #604 Merge Pdf using pyPDF\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines(Clean Code) of this project\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] I have created a helpful and easy to understand `README.md`\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [x] I have added tests/screenshots(if any) that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n- Input-1 \r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65889104/103413767-e1330580-4ba0-11eb-89a8-45fa226a161c.jpg)\r\n- Input 2\r\n![Capture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65889104/103413779-ee4ff480-4ba0-11eb-9818-d5fa5d6d8312.jpg)\r\n- Output\r\n![Capture3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65889104/103413789-fa3bb680-4ba0-11eb-86d1-d2bfeed2d3f4.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

At first, we can add those scripts which are already available in another language/platform. We add the PowerShell version (if doable).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThere are a lot of changes in PowerShell from Command Prompt, both in terms of syntax and strength, and PowerShell is often underlooked, so we may add basic scripts too.\r\n",

A good model for music genre classification is like a needle in haystack.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAfter working on Music classification for more than a year, I believe I can come up with a really good model. I will be using  Benchmark dataset, `GTZAN`, `Emotify` for example, Python offers TF, Keras and most importantly  `pyaudioanalysis` so i think Python is the best choice.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere are multiple models available, but either they are now old, they are using old algos like `SVM`, or old variants of Neighbours. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",

We would like you to introduce yourself and what are the fields that you work on. We would also love to have your Social Media Profiles so that we can connect over there and do mention that you are a participant at NJACK Winter of Code '2020.\r\n\r\nDuring this Winter of Code, we will be focussing on these specific topics: \r\n\r\n- Documentation\r\n- Automation and Scripting \r\n- Development of a Web Interface\r\n- Refactoring existing Code\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas around the same, we would love to have your opinion on it on the Gitter Channel. On further discussion, the apt issues would be created and assigned to you.\r\n\r\nHere are some 12 Rules, you should be following while doing Open-Source to make your Contributions shine during the whole process:\r\n- Be Nice, Be Respectful (BNBR)\r\n- Check if the Issue you created, exists or not.\r\n- Make proper commit messages and document your PR well.\r\n- Always add Comments in your Code and explain it at points.\r\n- Dynamic Input is always preferred over static Driver Code.\r\n- Squash your commits before you push them.\r\n- Always create a Pull Request from a Branch; Never from the Master.\r\n- Follow proper Code conventions. Using i, j in Loops show a poor understanding of Code Quality. Use proper Variable, Function Names.\r\n- Issues would be served on \"First Come, First Serve\" basis.\r\n- Issues would be tagged as Easy, Medium, Hard. Scores would be assigned on the difficulty of Issue you solve.\r\n- Code would be reviewed by Mentors before they are merged. Every PR requires 3 Reviews.\r\n- No person can take up more than 2 Issues at a single point of time.\r\n\r\n<b>Regards,</b>\r\n<i>Harsh Mishra (@harshcasper), Project Administrator</i> \ud83e\udd17",

Go to any issue with `Up-For-Grabs` label.\r\n2. Comment `/assign`\r\n3. The bot will assign the issue, but the `Up-For-Grabs` label is still present.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe bot should get rid of the prior label.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIn issue #508\r\n![issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49750343/100051062-ed5cd200-2e40-11eb-98c1-d7a09fe8287d.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows\r\n - Browser: Chrome\r\n - Version:  87.0.4280.66\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThere are a few more questions regarding the issue which I hope @HarshCasper will answer.\r\n\r\n1. Which label to put on the stale issue?\r\n1. How many days would be given before a warning (right now 7) is sent?\r\n1. After how many days of warning, should the issue be unassigned (right now 14 days after warning)\r\n1. Shall I change `/assign` to `/Rotten` for assigning issues.\r\n1. Who will make the respective change in the documentation, shall I do it?",

Please describe.**: \r\nWhile working on Audio Feature Extraction, I noticed that  ```.wav``` files are the vest format for Audio Processing because it is more accurate than mp3, is lossless, and also size optimized (unlike ```flac```). The problem is that there are not many sites from where you can download such files, and BenchMarked Datasets like GTZAN and EmoMusic also contain only `mp3` file. A script that would auto-convert such files would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**: \r\n\r\nA simple Python script that can convert audio files along with some additional functionality like downsampling, mono to stereo conversion.\r\n\r\n",

The code <em>may</em> still work, and\nnon-invasive patches to keep it working will be considered. However, more\nmodern tools no longer support old Node.js versions making testing difficult.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Removed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BREAKING</strong>: Remove <code>util.getPath</code>, <code>util.setPath</code>, and <code>util.deletePath</code>.\n<code>util.setPath</code> had a potential prototype pollution security issue when used\nwith unsafe inputs. These functions are not used by <code>forge</code> itself. They date\nfrom an early time when <code>forge</code> was targeted at providing general helper\nfunctions. The library direction changed to be more focused on cryptography.\nMany other excellent libraries are more suitable for general utilities. If\nyou need a replacement for these functions, consier <code>get</code>, <code>set</code>, and <code>unset</code>\nfrom <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">lodash</a>. But also consider the potential similar\nsecurity issues with those APIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.9.2 - 2020-09-01</h2>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>util.setPath</code> security note to function docs and to README.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SECURITY</strong>: The <code>util.setPath</code> function has the potential to cause\nprototype pollution if used with unsafe input.\n<ul>\n<li>This function is <strong>not</strong> used internally by <code>forge</code>.</li>\n<li>The rest of the library is unaffected by this issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not</strong> use unsafe input with this function.</li>\n<li>Usage with known input should function as expected. (Including input\nintentionally using potentially problematic keys.)</li>\n<li>No code changes will be made to address this issue in 0.9.x. The current\nbehavior <em>could</em> be considered a feature rather than a security issue.\n0.10.0 will be released that removes <code>util.getPath</code> and <code>util.setPath</code>.\nConsider <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> from <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">lodash</a> if you need\nreplacements. But also consider the potential similar security issues with\nthose APIs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODEFORGE-598677\">https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODEFORGE-598677</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7720\">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7720</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/8018c3ea6f8e75d2df1b9ce4ec9c536db3db37e6\"><code>8018c3e</code></a> Release 0.10.0.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/6a1e3ef74f6eb345bcff1b82184201d1e28b6756\"><code>6a1e3ef</code></a> Remove object path functions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/30d560c6b522b9a97a67d9101ecf8f860a4ba63a\"><code>30d560c</code></a> Remove Node.js 4 support.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/1ba83ecca436c2e1d0d37ea154467e9934019504\"><code>1ba83ec</code></a> Update dependencies.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/81abd87a9a8ef705af17d1e712a086ef4b7869a1\"><code>81abd87</code></a> Improve linting.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/7b59028142bb5f5e299df0d0931a8306d7d7046b\"><code>7b59028</code></a> Test on Node.js 14.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/ba13a1c8bfdb1d6abb286fa7fcb82a57b40ae345\"><code>ba13a1c</code></a> Update webpack.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/c8d5395e078f838604eb9df32ef9d298288057fd\"><code>c8d5395</code></a> Add travis browser test names.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/afc5a728f5c6bf5cb80eddb5b85c7340b28bfa51\"><code>afc5a72</code></a> Update dependencies.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/ba0207fa359f79a5af0e71d12f488a846e9265f6\"><code>ba0207f</code></a> Test on Node.js 12.</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/compare/0.9.1...0.10.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=node-forge&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=0.9.1&new-version=0.10.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/configuring-github-dependabot-security-updates)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Please describe.**: I kind of get lazy when to complete my assignments and to google each question individually to find the correct answers, so a script to do all of that for me.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**: The script will first use OCR to convert the image to a string. Then identify individual questions from the whole string and google answers for each of them. Use of cosine similarity to find relevant answers.\r\n\r\nFor the initial stage i would just be working on straight forward theory questions. I am still thinking a way to handle numericals , mcqs, match the following and all other type of questions. suggestions are much needed and most welcomed for this.\r\n\r\n**Additional suggestion**:  I have noticed there is not a separate OCR script existing. We can even have a separate issue for that if you want to add that as a separate issue. then I would like to work on it.\r\n\r\n",

Using i, j in Loops show a poor understanding of Code Quality. Use proper Variable, Function Names.\r\n- Issues would be served on \"First Come, First Serve\" basis.\r\n- Issues would be tagged as Easy, Medium, Hard. Scores would be assigned on the difficulty of Issue you solve.\r\n- Code would be reviewed by Mentors before they are merged. Every PR requires 3 Reviews.\r\n- No person can take up more than 2 Issues at a single point of time.\r\n\r\n<b>Regards,</b>\r\n<i>Harsh Mishra (@harshcasper), Project Administrator</i> \ud83e\udd17\r\n",

I enter a name and the Script should generate a list of Usernames possible out of my Initial Name and my Title and check which Username is available. In Python, you can make use of ```requests``` and ```random_word``` while in Javascript you can make use of a variety of HTTPS libraries for this purpose.",
