# Ask 'How to' Questions using Voice

For asking how to type questions firstly we are using the `SpeechRecognition` library so that our device can recognize our voice command to take input and then `pyttsx3` library for converting text to speech so that the device can speak up the results or output, and last important library is `pywikihow` to fetch the answers for how to type questions. 

## Packages Used
### SpeechRecognition

It is a library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, online and offline.

`SpeechRecognition` engine/API support:

- CMU Sphinx (works offline)
- Google Speech Recognition
- Google Cloud Speech API
- Microsoft Bing Voice Recognition
- Houndify API
- IBM Speech to Text

### pyttsx3 

`pyttsx3` is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. Works without internet connection or delay. Supports multiple TTS engines, including Sapi5, nsss, and espeak.

### pywikihow

`pywikihow` is an unofficial WikiHow python API. It uses BeautifulSoup to scrape WikiHow information and return the data that we want.

## Installation

Install all these libraries with `pip` command in any terminal by using the following command

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
