# Ask 'How to' Questions using Voice

For asking how to type questions firstly we are using the `SpeechRecognition` library so that our device can recognize our voice command to take input and then `pyttsx3` library for converting text to speech so that the device can speak up the results or output, and last important library is `pywikihow` to fetch the answers for how to type questions.
