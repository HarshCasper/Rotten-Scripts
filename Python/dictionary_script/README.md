## Dictionary Script
This is a dictionary application made with a JSON data set. The main aim of this script is to tell the meaning of the words entered by the user.
If the word entered by the user does not matches any word in the dictionary, then the script predicts the closest word from the dictionary. 

### Modules used in the dictionary:-
1. json
2. difflib

### Demonstration of the script:-

As it is shown that, the user had done a spelling mistake. The script suggested the closest possible word which is present in the dictionary, and gave the results to the user.
