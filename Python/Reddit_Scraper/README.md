# Reddit Scraper

- Using BeautifulSoup, a python library useful for web scraping, this script helps to scrape a desired subreddit to obtain all relevant data regarding its posts.

- We take user input for the subreddit name, and the maximum count of posts to be scraped, and store all this information in a `.csv` file of the user's choice.

## Setup instructions

- The requirements can be installed as follows:

```shell
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
