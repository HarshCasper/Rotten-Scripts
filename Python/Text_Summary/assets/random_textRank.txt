MIR systems perform various functionalities such as music recommendation and music recognition
MIR applications such as Shazam, SoundHound, and Gracenote have already been developed for the iPhone, iPad, and other such mobile devices.To develop a music retrieval system, first, it is necessary to create an audio fingerprint that can be matched against those stored in a music database
Music retrieval involves searching for music that is played over loudspeakers in public places such as a coffee shop or shopping mall, or even on the street
However, in such environments, the music is accompanied by background noise such as people’s voices, vehicular noises, or the sound of machinery.Recently, content-based music information retrieval (MIR) systems for mobile devices have attracted great interest
This increases the probability of correct music identification
