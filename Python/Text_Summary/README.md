Text Summarization is an advanced project and comes under the umbrella of Natural Language Processing.
There are multiple methods people use in order to summarize text.

they can be affectively clubbed under 2 methods:

- Abstractive: Understand the true context of text before summarization (like a human).
- Extractive: Rank the text within the file and identify the impactful terms.

While both these approaches are under research, extractive summarization is presently used across multiple platform.
There are multiple methods by which text is summarized under extractive approach as well.
