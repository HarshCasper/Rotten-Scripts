# Domain Name Availabilty Checker

- The python script uses GoDaddy's API to get all the domain names which are available according to the keyword given by user.
- All the results are stored in a ```.txt``` file, named after the keyword.


## Setup

- A virtual environment.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Generate your GoDaddy API KEY and Secret KEY from [here](https://developer.godaddy.com/keys)
- Paste the token in a `.env` file (Take [`.env.example`](.env.example) as an example)

## Running the script:


```sh
    $ python Domain_name.py
```
