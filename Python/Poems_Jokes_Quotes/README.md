# Poems Automation
For Poem Automation we are using `poetpy` library which is an unofficial Python wrapper for the PoetryDB API. 
The PoetryDB API allows users to find a vast amount of poetry and poet data and is free to use without any authentication required.

### Installation

Install with `pip` command in any terminal
```python
pip install poetpy
```

### Working

Import the `poetpy` library in the Python file that you are going to get the poems and then use the `get_poetry()` function to easily get poems into your console/application.

For example, we are interested in finding all of William Shakespeareâ€™s poems and sonnets available in the PoetryDB API then

```python
import poetpy

poems = poetpy.get_poetry('author', 'William Shakespeare')

print(poems)

```

# Jokes Automation
In this we are using pyjokes which is a python library used to get jokes for programmers. 
We can also call it as a fun python library that can be used simply with some lines of code.    

**Note:** It requires proper Internet connection for its working.

### Installation

Install with `pip` using any terminal

```python
pip install pyjokes
```

### Working

Import the `pyjokes` module in the Python file that you are going to get the jokes and then use the `get_joke()` function to easily get a random joke into your console/application.

```python
import pyjokes

joke = pyjokes.get_joke()

print(joke)
```
To get jokes in a specific language and for a particular category though there are not many categories and language but we can use those that are available.

```
import pyjokes

joke = get_joke(language="es",category="neutral")

print(joke)
```

# Quotes Automation
For this we are using `quote` library which is a python wrapper for the Goodreads Quote API. 
To generate a random quote we will be using the quote function from the quote module.

pip install poetpy
```

It is simple to use and `quote` library can also be used from the command line tool.
