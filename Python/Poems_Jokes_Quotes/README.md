# Poems Automation
For Poem Automation we are using `poetpy` library which is an unofficial Python wrapper for the PoetryDB API. 
The PoetryDB API allows users to find a vast amount of poetry and poet data and is free to use without any authentication required.

### Installation

Install with `pip` command in any terminal
```python
pip install poetpy
```

#### Working

Import the `poetpy` library in the Python file that you are going to get the poems and then use the `get_poetry()` function to easily get poems into your console/application.

For example, we are interested in finding all of William Shakespeareâ€™s poems and sonnets available in the PoetryDB API then

```python
import poetpy

poems = poetpy.get_poetry('author', 'William Shakespeare')

print(poems)

```
