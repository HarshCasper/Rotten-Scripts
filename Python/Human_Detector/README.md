# Human_Detector

A really basic (boilerplate) code for Human_detection using OpenCV.
The script `human_detector.py` is the Wrapper around, `HOG-SVM` model already implemented in OpenCV.

## Note

The aim of the script is not Accuracy, but ease of usability.


## Dependency

- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Imutils
- Jupyter
and associated packages.

These are summarised in `requirement.txt`


## Setup

1. A virtual environment (recommended)
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Open the [Jupyter Notebook](human_detector.ipynb).
1. The Steps, details and guidelines can be found in comments.


## Output

- Using Images

- Using Video

## Disclaimer
- I have used the most basic SVM Histogram, as it is simple to implement.
- Accuracy is not the Aim
- The Script is as simple as it can be
