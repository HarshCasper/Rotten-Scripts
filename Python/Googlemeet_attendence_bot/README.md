## Auto Attendence google meet

### A very simple python script that enters a google meet provided the link and creates an excel file containing the names of the people in the meeting(obviously u hv to tell the meeting host to allow the bot to enter the meeting:) )

## How to use the script
* install the requirements 
<br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* create a google account for the bot 
* set the email and the password in the corresponding field in main.py file 
* save the changes made to the file.
* run the main.py file after saving the changes.
* provide the meeting code when prompted in the terminal 
* That's it :))
* the attendence excel file will be saved in your desktop.
* the bot will automatically get out of the meeting after attendence is taken sucessfully.
