# Google Meet Scheduler

![](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)

The script [here](script.py) allows you to schedule a [google meeting](https://meet.google.com/) with multiple guests using [python](https://www.python.org/). You just need to provide the topic, time and list of email ids of the guests for the meeting and the [script](script.py) will handle the rest of the work.

## Setup

#### Step 1. You'll need to download a `credentials.json` file.

- Go to [https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python).

- Click the `Enable the Google Calendar API` button as shown below.

- Download the `credentials.json` file as shown below.
<p align="center"><img height="200px" src="images/4.PNG"></p>

- Move this file to the folder where your `script.py` resides.

#### Step 2. Modify this part of the code as per your needs.

#### Step 3. Install all the dependencies listed in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
- Just Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If facing any issue installing any package, just google it :)

#### Step 4. Now if you run the script for the first time then you'll be requested to grant some permissions.
- First of all you'll need to choose the google acount you want to use.

- Click on `Go to QuickStart` as shown below.
