Often whiling Video Lectures, we wish to capture the Screenshots and
save it. This process can be automated by creating a Script that can be
launched which runs in the background. Hence, here is a Python Script
which captures the screen and saves it in a Folder. ## Requirements -
Python 3.0 - Pip ## Steps to be followed to make a Screen Grabber 1.
Make a folder where you want to save all the screenshots. You can make
one on your Desktop, the way I did. 💁‍♀️ 2. Write this Python Script in
your code editor.
