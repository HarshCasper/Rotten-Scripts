# Change Image Background

#### AIM:  
We will build a project that can help us in changing the background of any image without using any image editor like Photoshop, etc. This project can be done with the help of some libraries using Python programming.
#### PURPOSE: 

In this project we will be changing the background of image with the help of some libraries using Python programming.

**LIBRARIES USED**
- **Numpy:** 

- **OpenCV:**

- **Matplotlib:** 

#### INSTALLATION:
Install the all the required libraries using `pip` command in any terminal

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### WORKFLOW:

1. We are importing the required libraries 
2. Reading the image as per our choice

4. Resizing the image, so that both the images can be of same size
5. Now with the help of and operation combining the masked image with background image
6. After that displaying and saving the final image

#### CONCLUSION:
We have created a project for changing the background of an image. And we have also learnt how to make such type of project for changing image background, the output we got with this project is also attached here.
