# CoVID Cases Scraper

For CoVID-19 Cases we are using the concept of web scraping, where we are fetching the data from a website called Worldometers. In this project we can fetch the data of Coronavirus (CoVID-19) cases for any country in the World. 

To do this we need two libraries `beautifulsoup4` and `requests`

### Beautifulsoup4

Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

### Requests 

Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your PUT & POST data — but nowadays, just use the json method!

## Installation

Install the following libraries using `pip` command in any terminal

```python
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```

OR

Follow the steps given under `Working`

And then import the `beautifulsoup4` and `requests` libraries in the Python file that you are going to use to get the Covid-19 cases information. These libraries provide functions to easily get the information from any web page to your console/application.
