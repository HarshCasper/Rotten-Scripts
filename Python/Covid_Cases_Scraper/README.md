# CoVID Cases Scraper

For CoVID-19 Cases we are using the concept of web scraping, where we are fetching the data from a website called Worldometers. In this project we can fetch the data of Coronavirus (CoVID-19) cases for any country in the World. 

To do this we need two libraries `beautifulsoup4` and `requests`

## Installation

Install the following libraries using `pip`:

```python
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```

OR

Import the `beautifulsoup4` and `requests` libraries in the Python file that you are going to use to get the Covid-19 cases information. These libraries provide functions to easily get the information from any web page to your console/application.
