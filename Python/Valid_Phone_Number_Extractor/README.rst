A simple Python Script to spit out all the mobile numbers or phone
numbers or both (according to userâ€™s requirements) to the output text
file while taking text from the input text file.

Usage
-----

-  Keep input file in the same folder/directory as of the script. Or,
   enter path to input file relative to the location of the script.
-  Run the following command ``python3 num_from_text.py -h`` for any
   help.

You should receive following output which pretty much explains all the
flags/arguments you can pass in through command line interface (CLI)

.. code-block:: bash

   usage: num_from_text.py [-h] [--mobile MOBILE] [--phone PHONE] [--all ALL]
                           [--output OUTPUT]

   Find mobile or phone numbers from input text file.

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --mobile MOBILE, -m MOBILE
                           Extract mobile numbers only.
     --phone PHONE, -p PHONE
                           Extract Phone Numbers only.
     --all ALL, -a ALL     Extract both Mobile Numbers and Phone Numbers.
     --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                           Name of output file.

.. note::
   
   If ``--output`` is not specified default file names will be used as output file name.
