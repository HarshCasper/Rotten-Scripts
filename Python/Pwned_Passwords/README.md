# Password Vulnerability Test

- The python script uses ```haveibeenpwned.com``` API to check if your password has been exposed to data breaches and how many times it has been seen.
- Such a <b>pwned</b> password should no longer be used as its exposure puts it at higher risk of being used to login to accounts using the now-exposed secret.

## Setting up

- For running the script, the packages can be installed as follows
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Paste the token (password) in a `.env` file (Take the [`.env.example`](.env.example) as an example)

## Running the script:
```shell
$ python pwned_checker.py
```
