# Video Watermarker

This script watermarks the entire video given the watermark text, it's position and margin. First the frames of the video are converted into images, then text is drawn and then saved in a list of images. After this entire process, the watermarked images are combined back to video  and then audio is added to the final output. The residual files created during the process are deleted when they are of no use.
