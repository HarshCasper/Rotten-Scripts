# Regex Query Tool
## Description
Regular search tools often fail to produce the desired results for specific queries. In simple words, a regex is a set of strings, which means that when you enter a query in this tool, it will check the validity of your query.If the regex can match patterns in the text query entered by the user, it notifies the user by highlighting all the matching patterns. 
- A Regex Query Tool allows users to quickly check the validity of their regex strings on the Web, thereby making the search process much easier. 
- Pythonâ€™s re library is the perfect tool for running the query strings on the user-inputted text.
