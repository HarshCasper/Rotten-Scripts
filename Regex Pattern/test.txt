            And then it started like a guilty thing
            Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
            The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
            Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
            Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
            Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
            The extravagant and erring spirit hies
            To his confine: and of the truth herein
            This present object made probation.

            It faded on the crowing of the cock.
            Some say that ever against that season comes
            Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
            The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
            And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
            The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
            No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
            So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

            So have I heard and do in part believe it.
            But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
            Walks over the dew of yon high eastward hill:
            Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
            Let us impart what we have seen to-night
            Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
            This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
            Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
            As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
