### Why use the github token?

It is true that github api is freely available for use by public but it is restricted to 60 requests per hour and for repositories with large number of issues this will exceed it's limit.
So do get your [`Github Developer Token`](https://dev.to/gr2m/github-api-authentication-personal-access-tokens-53kd) before running this script
