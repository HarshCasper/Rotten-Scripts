# GitHub Graph Populator

A simple JavaScript script to manipulate timestamps of GitHub contribution graph and create fake commits to make your GitHub profile look attractive. This script creates `data.json` file and stores/updates the date in this file on which the fake commit is made.

# Usage

- Create a private repository in your account(if you don't want everyone to know that you are making fake commits)
- Clone this repository and your private repository on your device
- Copy `GitHub Graph Populator` folder contents to your private cloned repository
- Open command line interface (CLI) and run
  - `npm install`
  - `node githubGraphPopulator.js`

**_Note:_** You can delete fake commits created by this script from your GitHub profile by simply deleting your private repository.
