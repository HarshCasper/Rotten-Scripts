GitHub Graph Populator
======================

|checkout|

A simple JavaScript script to manipulate timestamps of GitHub
contribution graph and create fake commits to make your GitHub profile
look attractive. This script creates ``data.json`` file and
stores/updates the date in this file on which the fake commit is made.

Usage
-----

-  Create a private repository in your account(if you donâ€™t want everyone to know that you are making fake commits)
-  Clone this repository and your private repository on your device
-  Copy ``GitHub Graph Populator`` folder contents to your private cloned repository
-  Open command line interface (CLI) and run

.. code-block:: bash

   npm install
   node githubGraphPopulator.js


.. note:: 
   You can delete fake commits created by this script from your GitHub profile by simply deleting your private repository.

.. warning::
