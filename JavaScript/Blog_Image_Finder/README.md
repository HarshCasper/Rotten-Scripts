# Script in JS used to get images

## About

Blogs are like caffine for writers for which they always tries to find interesting stuffs(images/quotes/GIFs) to encourage readers to read even a long blog.Now, Blogs are of various genres, so it is very difficuly for a writes to get apt images to insert in their blog. So, I've developed a script which is very much easy to use and which can find 20+ images instantly and also provides the link(Unsplash link).

## Explanation of code

- unsplash API is used to fetch all images(https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?per_page=30&query=[word]&client_id=[key])
    - An API key is required to use the API in your app, which can easily be obtained from [unsplash official website](https://unsplash.com/developers).
- Async/Await is used to consume promises.
- Script is dependent on a basic boilerplate HTML file, which displays all the images retreived by the script.
- To get link of any image, just click on that, a pop-up/alert window with link will appear.

## To run the code

- Clone the folder
- Inside the folder open index.html or in some editor you can use live-server to run HTML file.
- Then search images of which category/genre you want.
