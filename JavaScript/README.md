JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. 
JavaScript (abbreviated as JS), is a interpreted, high-level programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.

<b>Did you know:</b> JavaScript was created in 10 days only and when released, it used to cover a very small portion of a proper programming language.
