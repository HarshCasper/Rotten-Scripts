Try OBS or Bandicam. A demonstration helps us to ensure that such scripts work properly. alternatively send us some screenshot that can properly justify the working of scirpt",vybhav72954

 Hi @SmritiAgrawal04 <https://github.com/SmritiAgrawal04>

 Great Work! I have a few questions: Is the sole purpose of this Script to
 convert an Image to grayscale?

 If yes, can we think of some customizations to this, that can make it near
 to an actual camscanner?
