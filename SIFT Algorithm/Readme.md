# SIFT(Scale invariant Feature Transform)

- In this script, we implement the `SIFT algorithm` of `OpenCV` by using `Python`.
- The SIFT features are local and based on the appearance of the object at particular interest points, and are invariant to image scale and rotation.

## Setup instructions

- This algorithm is patented, so this algorithm is included in the Non-free module in OpenCV.
- For using this script, you need to use the `Open CV version <3.0` and additonally you need to install the `opencv-contrib-python` of the same version.
