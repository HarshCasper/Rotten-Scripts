# SIFT(Scale invariant Feature Transform)

- In this script, we implement the `SIFT algorithm` for the feature exatraction from an image
- After that create a test image by adding Scale Invariant and Rotational Invariant to the input image by which the resolution and alignment of the input image is changed.
- After this we use `Brute Force Matcher algorithm` for the matching the feature of the input and test image.
- The SIFT features are local and based on the appearance of the object at particular interest points, and are invariant to image scale and rotation.

## Setup instructions

- This algorithm is patented, so this algorithm is included in the Non-free module in OpenCV.
- For using this script, you need to use the `Open CV version <3.0` and additonally you need to install the `opencv-contrib-python` of the same version.
- User need to input the path of the image for which user want to extract the features
